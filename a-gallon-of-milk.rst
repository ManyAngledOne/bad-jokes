A Gallon of Milk
================

So, a gallon of milk walks into a convenience store. Gallon of milk pulls out a
gun and demands all the money in the cash register. The clerk behind the
counter complies, puts all the money into a bag, and hands it over to the
gallon of milk. The gallon of milk escapes to its home. After a while, the
video surveillance footage from the convenience store was on the television
news, and wanted posters of the gallon of milk were all over town. Gallon of
milk was getting anxious: it takes a rennet tablet and turns itself into a
block of cheese. Gallon of milk, now a small block of cheese, goes into town.
Everything was going fine until a passer-by stops the small block of cheese in
the street. The passer-by says, "Hey, you look familiar! Do I know you from
somewhere?!"

The small block of cheese replies: "No whey!"
