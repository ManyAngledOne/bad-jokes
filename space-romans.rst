============
Space Romans
============

Once upon a time there were these Space Romans. The Space Roman senators did
not like the fact that Space Caesar was turning the Space Republic into a
dictatorship. They plotted, and they planned, deciding what to do about it.
After discussing various scenarios, they finally settled on one plot. One day
as Caesar sat in the Space Senate, the group of senators converged upon Caesar,
lunging to sever the hose connecting his bubble helmet to his oxygen tank.

Caesar, gasping for air, makes eye-contact with his best friend and says, "O2,
Brute?"
